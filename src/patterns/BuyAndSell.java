 *
 * Description : Write a program that takes an array denoting the daily stock price, and returns the
 *               maximum profit that could be made by buying and then selling one share of that stock.
 *
 * This problem is concerned with the problem of optimally buying and selling a stock
 * once, as described on Page 2. As an example, consider the following sequence of
 * stock prices: (310,315, 275, 295, 260, 270, 290, 230, 255, 250). The maximum profit that
 * can be made with one buy and one sell is 30â€”buy at 260 and sell at 290. Note that
 * 260 is not the lowest price, nor 290 the highest price.
